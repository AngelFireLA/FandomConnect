#The number next to Exemple, is the plugin's way to recognize what value to put here, so for example, it will always replace Exemple6 by religion, you can remove some parts, but you musn't rename the name associated with the exemple (like religion, race). If you want it to appear differently, changed the template wikicode directly :
#Exemple1 = Player Name | Exemple2 = RP Name | Exemmple3 = age | Exemple4 = dead_or_alive | Exemple5 = titles | Exemple6 = religion | Exemple7 = jobs | Exemple8 = race | (towny : Exemple9 = money | Exemple10 = town| Exemple11 =nation)
#Also, you musn't put space before or after |
